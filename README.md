# TangibleUI-System

This is a system built for tangible UI interaction consisting of affordance detection, TUI generation and TUI operation.

This system is built using Meta Quest3 and Unity 6. If you want to give it a try, please following the PassthroughCameraSample to set up your unity.

You can try the system in the Code/Asset/TUI/TUI.scene. You can only build and run the apk file on your quest. When you press button A on your right controller, the system will scan your environment and the application you open. Then it will return a mathching result to your device. 

New feature remained undeveloped.
- TUI Generation
- TUI operation

coming soon...
